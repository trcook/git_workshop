# Problems

## Three challenges with managing data

1. Long-term reproducability
3. Version management
2. Collaboration with others


- Let's talk about some common scenarios



## Long-term reproducability and Mysterious Data:

* Get novel data file
* Make some changes to it
* Save over original file


## Six months later...

* Return to project...
    * what does `log_inerv_1234.b` mean? How did I it? Why is it driving my results?
* Even worse if someone asks for your replication data
    * you need to be able to explain how you arrived at a given variable/model/etc


---

## Partial Solution:

* Make R script, DO file or other script that generates data from pristine data files.
